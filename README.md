# Mario's Treasure Hunt

Our game is designed to encourage students to think critically and collaboratively. Using a Turtlebot4 robot as Mario, students work together to arrange an obstacle course that maximizes coin collection as they set up a pathway for Mario to reach the end of a course represented by a flag.
